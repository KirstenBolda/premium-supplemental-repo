## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a useful thing to do while learning even if you don't do this at your eventual job (e.g. you want to be a solo freelancer).  It's more a specific dynamic for working together than a technical tool per se.  Some developer teams will occasionally use this skill in order to get past technical issues.
