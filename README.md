# Supplementary Resource Repo

This extra repo is designed to be consumed at your leisure, perhaps when on-the-go or needing a break from VS Code, in parallel with your technical learning through Codecademy Premium.  In that way, it will provide some contextual and augmenting knowledge to help you to reach your objective.

Happy coding and happy learning!  Let's turn it up.
