# Supplementary Resource Repo

This extra repo is designed to be consumed at your leisure, perhaps when on-the-go or needing a break from VS Code, in parallel with your technical learning through Codecademy Premium.  In that way, it will provide some contextual and augmenting knowledge to help you to reach your objective.

*General Advice* was written for every Premium participant and should be read first, while the other subjects may or may not be applicable to you depending on your goals.  The units are designed to be consumed in numerical order, but that's not a strict constraint, feel free to browse!

Please note that this repo is **still under development**.  We always welcome your requests and input, just post in #feedback in Slack.

Happy coding and happy learning!  Let's do this.
