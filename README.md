# Supplementary Resource Repo

This extra repo is designed to be consumed at your leisure, perhaps when on-the-go or needing a break from VS Code, in parallel with your technical learning through Codecademy Premium.

Please note that this repo is **still under development**.  We always welcome your requests and input, just post in #feedback in Slack.

Happy coding and happy learning!  Let's do this.
