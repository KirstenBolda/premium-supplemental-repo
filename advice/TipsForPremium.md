# How to Get the Most out of Premium

You have the benefit of being in one of the later waves of people to join Premium, so let's take a moment for some of your predecessors to chip in with what has helped them to get the most out of this program.  First, we'll summarize some discussions where multiple learners and mentors agreed on some best practices, then we'll cover some advice from some of the more experienced learners.

## Suggestions From the "Hive Mind"

Here are some points that had broad consensus from mentors and / or mentees in the various discussions in our Slack group so far:

* Developers don't need to remember everything they come across!  Instead, internalize the _concepts_, get better at asking (and answering) questions, and finding the info you need as you go.  Work on building the right mentality rather than rote memorization - this [six minute video](https://youtu.be/rWMuEIcdJP4) from one of our mentors will explain the "developer mindset."
* Don't go through an entire unit of theory before starting the associated practical assignment.  That method is more time-consuming as you'll keep having to go back to the unit for things you've forgotten.  Better to do part of the unit and part of the assignment, in tandem.  Familiarize yourself with the next steps with your project before digging in to the theoretical learning; once you feel confident enough in some theory to apply it to your project, do so.
* Take your own notes.  Yes, there are downloadable notes out there, but the act of writing the notes itself helps you to remember them, especially if you're putting them all in your own words.  [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) and [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) are two popular free methods, but also consider taking physical notes with a pen and assembling an organized binder of notes, as the tactile experience can also aid recall.
* If you don't already have a dream project, don't agonize about getting one.  Just get started early with something simple like a personal portfolio site, and take your time to think of a more robust project to tackle later.
* Agree with your mentor about a best time to meet each week (e.g. Saturdays at 2pm EST) and then consistently book that slot well in advance. This makes it easier for both parties, but also adds vital structure and accountability.
* A lot of introductory material goes over concepts that have already been covered in the Codecademy courses – if you've already covered something, you can probably skip it, but check with your mentor to be sure.
* Take part in weekly standup on Slack to get used to Agile development rituals, to add more structure & accountability to your learning, and for more of a "classroom" experience.

## Personal Suggestions From Long-term Learners

### John

[John](https://github.com/jrob200) is an experienced Product Manager from one of the big five tech companies and a Premium learner since November 2019 class.  His advice is to:

>1. Stick to a schedule but be realistic about the time commitment.  Check the upcoming unit early in the week to estimate time commitment.  I have caught myself trying to complete something I thought was short at the last minute.
>2. Do not move forward until you are comfortable with the concepts introduced.  This will be an issue later when those inital lessons combine to build more advanced concepts.
>3. Might be a time constraint for some, but I need practice often, every few days at the least, to keep the material fresh.  Even if it is just one practice problem on codewars or similar.
>4. Do not hesitate to ask questions in Slack, of your mentor, etc.  Learning is rarely a solo journey.

### Greg

[Greg](https://github.com/gregrancourt) is a devops engineer who's learning full-stack engineering to build his business MVP idea.

>* Really devote some time up front to coming up with a project idea you have an emotional connection to. It’s a tough journey, but it’s even harder if you don’t care about the end goal.
>* Along with that, one thing I wish I’d done differently up front was spend more time describing my project goals with my mentor and reshaped the experience to meet those goals. It would have reduced some rework and given me more depth in the areas I needed to learn most.
>* Set a habit, whether it’s a certain time of day or certain day of week, to do the majority of your work. Having it scheduled makes it easier to stick to.
>* Slack it up - meet people and get to know them and their projects. It’s a lot more fun to share this experience with other people.

### Christina

[Christina] is learning full-time to switch from a medical career to become a programmer, clocking in hundreds of hours since October 2019.

>When approaching the material I like to keep in mind a story someone shared with me (found [here](http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/1acupoftea.html)).
>
>With material I am somewhat familiar with, I try to approach it as if I have never seen it before and learn all I can in that moment. I know I am not learning optimally the moment I think to myself, “Oh, I know this… I’ve seen this, I can just scan it, I don’t need to go over it again”.
>
>With new-to-me things, I take notes, watch videos/read about the topics until it seems boring… then read some more.  Take the time, don’t rush the process.
>And finally,
>* Don’t close your mind to one way of doing things, stay open to the advice others give.
>* Celebrate _all_ victories, no matter how small (there's nothing like a home office victory lap :laughing:)
>* Break big problems into many small ones. Still too big? Break it up again.
>* Show yourself some grace in the difficult moments and realize you are learning something that is **insanely cool** and that will take some time/practice.

### Abdel

[Abdel](https://github.com/AbdelkaderTk) is a doctor who has been building his business [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) as his Premium project since October 2019.  He shared the following:

>Try to answer questions from otber people (in the Premium Slack, or even on Stack Overflow). It is possible to help others, even for beginners. It will help the person who asked, but you also learn much faster. The more problems you encounter, the more you learn. So if you tackle your own problems _and_ try to solve others', you'll learn much more.
>If you try to summarize a lesson in your notes (without copying/pasting the material), you will quickly know if you actually understood what you just consumed. It takes more time up front, but you'll understand and remember better so you'll save time later.
