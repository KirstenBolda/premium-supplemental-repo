# How to Get the Most out of Premium

You have the benefit of being in one of the later waves of people to join Premium, so let's take a moment for some of your predecessors to chip in with what has helped them to get the most out of this program.  First, we'll summarize some discussions where multiple learners and mentors agreed on some best practices, then we'll cover some advice from some of the more experienced learners.

## Suggestions From the "Hive Mind"

Here are some points that had broad consensus from mentors and / or mentees in the various discussions in our Slack group so far:

* Developers don't need to remember everything they come across!  Instead, internalize the _concepts_, get better at asking (and answering) questions, and finding the info you need as you go.  Work on building the right mentality rather than rote memorization - this [six minute video](https://youtu.be/rWMuEIcdJP4) from one of our mentors will explain the "developer mindset."
* Don't go through an entire unit of theory before starting the associated practical assignment.  That method is more time-consuming as you'll keep having to go back to the unit for things you've forgotten.  Better to do part of the unit and part of the assignment, in tandem.  Familiarize yourself with the next steps with your project before digging in to the theoretical learning; once you feel confident enough in some theory to apply it to your project, do so.
* Take your own notes.  Yes, there are downloadable notes out there, but the act of writing the notes itself helps you to remember them, especially if you're putting them all in your own words.  [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) and [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) are two popular free methods, but also consider taking physical notes with a pen and assembling an organized binder of notes, as the tactile experience can also aid recall.
* If you don't already have a dream project, don't agonize about getting one.  Just get started early with something simple like a personal portfolio site, and take your time to think of a more robust project to tackle later.
* Agree with your mentor about a best time to meet each week (e.g. Saturdays at 2pm EST) and then consistently book that slot well in advance. This makes it easier for both parties, but also adds vital structure and accountability.
* A lot of introductory material goes over concepts that have already been covered in the Codecademy courses – if you've already covered something, you can probably skip it, but check with your mentor to be sure.
* Take part in weekly standup on Slack to get used to Agile development rituals, to add more structure & accountability to your learning, and for more of a "classroom" experience.
* Don't save your questions for your 1-on-1s because your mentor conversations are far more valuable with things like code review and pair-programming than Q&A. Always ask in Slack first.

## Personal Suggestions From Long-Term Learners

The following learners are among those who have been with us the longest and made the most progress!

### John

John is an experienced Product Manager from one of the big five tech companies and a Premium learner since November 2019.  His advice is to:

>1. Stick to a schedule but be realistic about the time commitment.  Check the upcoming unit early in the week to estimate time commitment.  I have caught myself trying to complete something I thought was short at the last minute.
>2. Do not move forward until you are comfortable with the concepts introduced.  This will be an issue later when those inital lessons combine to build more advanced concepts.
>3. Might be a time constraint for some, but I need practice often, every few days at the least, to keep the material fresh.  Even if it is just one practice problem on codewars or similar.
>4. Do not hesitate to ask questions in Slack, of your mentor, etc.  Learning is rarely a solo journey.

### Michael

Michael is one of the more advanced learners with Premium, having been learning consistently for over a year and now working on interview practice.

>What works for me is having a schedule for when I do things in the weekday mornings, which I make sure to use for light duty stuff to keep my continuity and stay in touch with my goals. I try to save the more in depth project work for the weekend. I have balanced and rebalanced things to make time for meeting up with friends and doing the things that keep me sane. I've learned that when I try to be hardcore, I burn out. But that's just what works for me, anyway.

### Greg

Greg is a devops engineer who's learning full-stack engineering to build his business MVP idea.  He recommends:

>* Really devote some time up front to coming up with a project idea you have an emotional connection to. It’s a tough journey, but it’s even harder if you don’t care about the end goal.
>* Along with that, one thing I wish I’d done differently up front was spend more time describing my project goals with my mentor and reshaped the experience to meet those goals. It would have reduced some rework and given me more depth in the areas I needed to learn most.
>* Set a habit, whether it’s a certain time of day or certain day of week, to do the majority of your work. Having it scheduled makes it easier to stick to.
>* Slack it up - meet people and get to know them and their projects. It’s a lot more fun to share this experience with other people.

### Christina

Christina is learning full-time to switch from a medical career to become a programmer, clocking in hundreds of hours since October 2019.  She suggests:

>When approaching the material I like to keep in mind a story someone shared with me (found [here](http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/1acupoftea.html)).
>
>With material I am somewhat familiar with, I try to approach it as if I have never seen it before and learn all I can in that moment. I know I am not learning optimally the moment I think to myself, “Oh, I know this… I’ve seen this, I can just scan it, I don’t need to go over it again”.
>
>With new-to-me things, I take notes, watch videos/read about the topics until it seems boring… then read some more.  Take the time, don’t rush the process.
>And finally,
>* Don’t close your mind to one way of doing things, stay open to the advice others give.
>* Celebrate _all_ victories, no matter how small (there's nothing like a home office victory lap :laughing:)
>* Break big problems into many small ones. Still too big? Break it up again.
>* Show yourself some grace in the difficult moments and realize you are learning something that is **insanely cool** and that will take some time/practice.

### Natalia

Natalia has already pushed beyond the level where many bootcamps take people and going deeper into advanced topics.

>What helps me to continue learning is to keep a solid routine everyday of the week and not allow anything else to interrupt. I agree with @Christina to celebrate the small things no matter what! Things that don't work for me is putting off any bit of the material in the units. They are there for a purpose to continue your learning.

### Abdel

Abdel is a doctor who has been building his business [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) as his Premium project since October 2019.  He shared the following:

>Try to answer questions from otber people (in the Premium Slack, or even on Stack Overflow). It is possible to help others, even for beginners. It will help the person who asked, but you also learn much faster. The more problems you encounter, the more you learn. So if you tackle your own problems _and_ try to solve others', you'll learn much more.
>If you try to summarize a lesson in your notes (without copying/pasting the material), you will quickly know if you actually understood what you just consumed. It takes more time up front, but you'll understand and remember better so you'll save time later.

### Samantha

Samantha has been juggling working in Premium alongside her full-time design job since September 2019.

> i also agree that time management is a key factor to your success in this program. i started guns blazing and thought i could commit like 8 hours a day with my full-time job and soon found myself burnt out and only doing the bare minimum :sweat_smile: i've since pivoted and decided to commit at least an hour a day during the work week. i keep track of how much time i spent studying a day to keep myself accountable and to celebrate small successes at the end of the week when i see how much i've dedicated to studying. it's a marathon, not a sprint lol.
> it's ok to feel like you don't know anything or like you're falling behind because you're here to learn! i've had to remind myself it's part of the process and no one expects me to know everything right off the bat.
> i'm a visual learner so sometimes if a unit is too text heavy for me, i start feeling like it's a chore and become bored. when that's the case, i try to supplement my learning with something that has more visual elements (usually it involves googling sites that offer more visuals like css-tricks, flipping through jon duckett's book, or looking for YT videos to watch people code)
> making use of the slack community also helps. i'm a bit shy/introverted most of the time, which is why i haven't been as present there, but i'm trying to be more active in the chats because i agree it does help with retention :stuck_out_tongue:

### Rostyslav

Rostyslav has been one of the most consistent learners in the whole program, completing a unit or more a week since October 2019.

>1. Study every day, and as much as possible. If it seems to you that you don't have enough time today, still find 1 hour to code.
>2. There are days, when you feel like you are fed up with coding, because to become a good developer is hard task (you are not learning how to deliver pizza or do some other simple job!), so be persistent: keep sitting in front of your computer. You will face these bugs, you will do these mistakes, and they will drive you nuts. Most people will naturally give up. But you will stay at all costs! And if you do that, if you embrace all the problems you face as great learning opportunities - you will become a great coder. Growth in life is only achieved by making yourself feel uncomfortable. 
>3. Use time management. For example I use Pomodoro, which means 25 minutes work, 5 minutes rest (there is an app in the Apple store). And I write down the time I spend learning every day, so later I compare my present week time with the previous one, and plan my pace for the next week. Set yourself goal of weekly hours you gonna spend on coding and follow it.
>4. Codecademy lessons are great! Use them in combination with books, blogs, videos. Ask your mentor for some extra which are not in the Units.

### Rebecca

Rebecca is a QA Engineer and Project Manager, and she happens to be the very first Premium learner.

>In general - set things up to make it hard for you to fail.
>1. You can reframe your project into something silly. I felt a lot of pressure and kept getting stuck in the rabbit hole of perfectionism because I wanted it to look great immediately. If you reframe it to something silly, like O'Duffy's fabulous suggestion of a "website for cat psychologist", it can take the edge of and make it easier to feel like you succeed with your units.
>2. Book several times, pref. with a regular interval, with your  mentor, to make it more difficult for yourself to just not book a time
>3. Don't stare yourself blind on that you have to complete the next unit for your next mentor meeting. End your mentor meetings with discussing "what should you do until next session", and preferably keep it to something so small that you feel pumped and you most definitely will complete it. If you do more, then that's awesome!
>4. Code/work on your project often, but also define coding to be something very easy. If it's super lightly defined, it's easier to succeed and keep your spirits up. For example, I have set the bar at "doing one review and practice unit in the Codecademy Go app" as my lower limit for coding each day. Similarly, trying to set an every day meditation habit, I've set succeeding to "opening the meditation app while in a calm setting". Often I do more, but if I can't manage more, at least it's easy not to break my streak!
