# Advice from a Fellow Founder

## Once Upon a Time…

Around 2014-2015, I decided to leave my job in management consulting to enter the notoriously risky world of startups (in a developing country no less). At the time, full of energy and conviction, I read every article I could get my hands on and talked to every founder I could meet about their experiences. Five plus years later and at the tail-end of a rocky but ultimately wonderful and transformative ride which included hiring a team, raising capital, building out a product, pivoting and building a new product, moving to Latin America and completing over half a dozen accelerators and incubators, here are some of the lessons I wish I could share with myself when I first started. They say hindsight is 20/20 so here is what I think I did well and where I would improve. There's tons of startup building advice out there, and I'll include some of it in a reading list below, but most of the popular stuff was authored by or about mega-successful multi-millionaires like Peter Thiel or Elon Musk, and the idea of this post is that it can be something a bit more… realistic.  Most startups fail, and most of us aren't Elon Musk (but if you _are_ Elon Musk and you're reading this, I'm a big fan of your cameo in Iron Man 2).  In this article, I'll blend my narrative and experiences with a range of resources that helped me and I hope will help you too.  Let's go!

## Don't Start With What, Start With Why

First off, congratulations! I remember when I first started, I felt like the luckiest human alive because I had found something I was so passionate about that I was willing to take a significant risk and make major sacrifices and lifestyle changes. In my case, my startup had a social impact mission which directly influenced my commitment, but, regardless, there is a reason for the cliches that say a startup is a roller coaster and having a true understanding of why you are pursuing this path is key. My recommendation? Sit down and write out your “why.” Ask yourself “why are you doing this?” “Why do you believe this is a problem?” “Why do you think you are the one to solve this issue?” etc. Take the time to draft out that information because when you are experiencing a low or have a difficult business decision to make, it will help enormously to have clear answers to come back to for guidance. This may sound silly, after all, you want to get started and there is so much to do - fundraising, product building, customers, team, etc. but I can’t stress enough how taking the time to define what you believe in and stand for will guide you as you navigate this tricky but rewarding path.

Focusing on the _why_ will also help you when you inevitably [pivot](https://www.inc.com/alan-spoon/what-pivot-really-means.html).  During my nearly five years of running my company, we underwent two major pivots and countless smaller ones. Having a sense of why will help you align on how you wish to pivot and what to.  For more info on "starting with why" see the reading list at the end of this article.

## Early Considerations

It might feel silly to think through a lot of the below when you haven't even incorporated yet let alone finished your MVP, but at least skim this list and keep them in the back of your mind until you're ready to return to them.  You can save yourself a lot of headaches later.

### Investment (Time and Money)

* Your lifestyle goals 
  * What type of hours do you want to work?
  * What is the  length of time you want to run your company (do you want to just get it off the ground? Do you want to run it full time for the length of your career?)
* Your exit goals 
  * Do you want to exit (e.g., IPO or sell?)
  * Do you want it to remain a stand-alone company?
* How do you plan to finance your company?
  * Again exit will matter to potential investors
  * Are you willing to give up equity to investors?
  * Are you willing to give up equity to future employees in exchange for their work? (This is common, especially at an early stage).
  * Do you want to raise via grants? (while more common for non-profits this is quite rare in general)
  * Are you willing to "bootstrap" self-finance your company?  You should be. (more detail on bootstrapping [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrap.asp))
  * Key note: There is often a perception that raising capital will solve all of your issues when in reality it produces many additional challenges as you have new stakeholders who have a say. How you finance will affect your business.

### Starting a Team

Another critical consideration is your team. In most cases, you will want to have a co-founder (or several); however, you must have a truly aligned with these individuals. Many of the same questions that you will need to answer to determine your long-term goals with your company will also be the questions you will need to make sure you are on the same page surrounding with co-founders. Co-founder conflicts are numerous and a lot of them come down to a few key concerns:

1. How committed are each of you? Certainly, in this exciting time, it can be easy to assume you are all equally committed but it is important to discuss limits. Questions to consider include:
    * What are you willing to sacrifice financially for this company?
    * Are you willing to relocate if necessary?
    * Can you support yourself without an income?
    * How long do you want to be involved?
    * How much equity do you want?
2. How will decisions be made?
    * If in a dead-lock on a decision, before building a board, who will make decisions?
    * How will work be distributed (to an extent this will be driven by roles such as CTO vs. CEO but still worth discussing)
    * Do you have any hard limits when it comes to changes or pivots (e.g., moral, etc.)
    * How do you plan to communicate (especially important if you are not in the same location)?
    * How do you both solve problems and handle disputes?
    * Have you worked successfully together before? This is especially important if you're founding with family or friends, this stuff can get messy fast and your BFF can become your bête noire in the blink of an eye.
    * Do you both truly have the right backgrounds to make this work?

Outside of co-founders, you will have many other team-related decisions to consider. Of course, when starting you will want to learn to do as much as possible on your own and shouldn’t focus on building a full team but you may need some support. Depending on your funding levels right out of the gate, it is unlikely that you will be hiring a full-team but there are ways to get things done while saving cash. Common options including sourcing interns for school credits or stipends, outsourcing technology development to development shops abroad, and hiring through Fiverr and other platforms for work ranging from admin support to graphic design, mailing lists, etc.

There are pros and cons to this type of support:
Pros: 
* Allows you to prioritize your time, especially if you are starting while still working full or part-time
* Won’t waste time on learning tasks that could be done quickly by someone with experience (e.g., graphic design, etc.)
* Will quickly get a sense of what it is like to manage individuals in certain roles and what types of skills are truly needed 

Cons:
* While there is very strong talent available, there is some truth to the phrase that you get what you pay for 
* Freelance talent especially interns often require a fair amount of hand-holding 
* You will waste significant money down the road if you do not learn how to do basic work (e.g., mail-chimp, updating your website)
* Key tip: your employee needs will evolve over time regardless of your initial “perfect” plan.

## Getting Support

Now, to the most exciting and important part: users, product, and the two combining. Finding [product-market fit](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/how-to-know-if-youve-got-productmarket) is extremely difficult. Since you have an MVP, the key here will be to determine what metrics you want to test in a pilot and how to modify your product. It is imperative to realistically evaluate the market and not get blinded by your own opinions. Links to X, Y and Z will help to clarify. A successful pilot of your MVP that achieves (and ideally exceed) metrics you have set out will attract mentors, team members, investors, and accelerators/incubators.  If you wind up being lucky enough to have a choice between different support systems, please remember that there is significant value in mentorship style support and not just cash.

There are several ways to garner support for your work, but most of them are predicated upon showing some form of proof that you're worth supporting. Ideas are cheap, and success is rare, so how you can scale effectively and illustrate results to an investor or supporter with limited resources? Ways to garner interest include: 
* Build an MVP (congrats - you're already working on this, or building your skills to be able to do this, in Premium)
* Show traction - this will be different depending on your industry and type of product (e.g., a B2B insurance platform might use different metrics to a B2C freemium app).  Examples include users, hit rates, activity/use.  Letters of Intent can even help.
* Get revenue - it's all about those dollar bills in the end
* Get endorsements from mentors or other industry leaders

## Mentors

Mentors are key for a variety of reasons and you will need a range of them. There is a common philosophy to get high-profile mentors but often for the earliest stages who you need is someone who has recently been there. When I was first finding mentors, I looked through local accelerators for start-up founders whose company had some similarities to mine (e.g., social impact, healthcare, international) who had recently closed a seed round and completed an accelerator or incubator. I then looked on LinkedIn and through my social networks to find connections to these founders and asked if we could meet-up for 30 minutes so I could get advice. I certainly came into these conversations with a series of specific questions but I also let them direct the conversation and provide me insights. These conversations were useful for a host of reasons including that the founders could provide me with insights into different networking events to attend, connections to some of their mentors (which led to more senior mentorship), advice on getting customers and building an MVP, and warnings about pitfalls to avoid. While some of my mentors became regular advisors to me and others were one-off meetings, I did find them all valuable. Ultimately these mentors were able to provide references to accelerators and investors and in certain cases became investors themselves. An important caveat is that you will need a ton of mentorship from a range of individuals so you may get differing or dissenting advice. It is important to take each piece of advice with a grain of salt. I emphasize pivoting but you do not want to be constantly pivoting your entire model based on every 30-minute coffee with a mentor.

## Accelerators

Accelerators fit in well with mentorship and essentially provide key introductions and access to mentors along with other amenities and resources such as co-working space, discounts on key services such as AWS, and, in cases, investment. I personally did multiple accelerators and found them incredibly useful. For me, the biggest value in accelerators came when their missions were closely aligned with my companies’. For example, when we were expanding into Mexico, we did a healthcare accelerator for companies’ expanding into Mexico; quite a niche but incredibly useful to be part of a cohort of founders all navigating similar complexities. It can be very difficult to get into some of the higher quality accelerators and not all are created equal so I recommend looking for very specific ones that align with your vision and being very clear on what you want to get out of it (e.g. network? Funding? Introductions to clients? Technology support? Peers?). No one wants to be the first to commit to a startup whether its an accelerator or an investor so sometimes the best path to getting into your first program is to look at ones where you already have inroads. For example, my first accelerator was related to my undergrad university and my second included many advisors who had worked with me at my first job out of school. Both of those programs taught me incredible information on pitching, gaining traction, support, and providing metrics which ultimately got me on the radar of the first accelerator to invest actual capital. Much like mentorship, you do need to strike a fine balance between too little and too much time spent on accelerators and can’t change your entire vision based on each program but at the early stages, they are invaluable. 

## Avoiding Distractions

Much like pivoting the other common theme that I encourage first-time founders to consider is how to avoid time-sucks and other resource wastes. I recall seeing a lot of people when I first started who would purchase expensive swag for their company and other extravagances (e.g., fancy office amenities). While there are exceptions where this is necessary from a marketing perspective, I highly discourage it. First off, it is unlikely to move the needle significantly in-terms of growth (again, there are exceptions) but it does signal to potential investors that you are getting ahead of yourself and may not be careful with finances. Similarly, there is incredible value in getting into pitch and networking events and I do encourage participation, but, you need to be careful to evaluate the ROI. While difficult, being brutally honest with yourself throughout the startup building process and not falling prey to the hype is critical. Part of founding a startup is being overly optimistic, and you need to be that way, but also very self-critical and brutally honest with yourself about the status of your endeavor. 

## Be Kind to Yourself

On that note, the final key topic I want to address is mental health with startups. Founding a company is hard; it is emotionally draining and comes with constant highs and lows. Additionally, in the spirit of being constantly optimistic, you will often find your peers claim to be “killing it” when you feel you are struggling. Trust me - with few exceptions, everyone is having a hard time. That is not to be discouraging; founding Develop Link was one of the best experiences of my life, but just to provide some perspective. Mental health concerns including depression or anxiety are common among startup founders. Even just acknowledging that can help founders not feel as alone. Self-care and mental healthcare are different for everyone and I am not a mental healthcare professional, but do take time to figure out what your limits are for this venture. For example, I will put my savings into my business to get it going but will not cash out my 401k for it (seriously, do not cash out your 401k), or I am willing to move geographically but only for 2 years. Know your limits and be willing to stretch yourself for your startup but have boundaries. One of the best pieces of advice a mentor gave me was that whenever I thought there was no solution, I should get myself a hotel room (it helped I had tons of points from my management consulting days so it was free) and spend two days not talking to anyone, relaxing, but also brainstorming solutions. I recall thinking this was frivolous advice but time and time again it proved to provide me with the mental space to recharge but also get creative and continue the good fight. Combining that space with having a few friends who are in a similar situation and get the stress is incredible. One of my close friends, who I met in an accelerator, and I dubbed the anxiety that comes with money stress and hitting metrics “the feeling” and it was so valuable to be able to just text her that I had “the feeling” and needed to have completely honest chats about the path forward. Addressing these challenges will be unique for each individual but those were some strategies that helped me.

## Have Fun

As I said at the beginning of this article: CONGRATULATIONS! This is such an exciting time in your life and you will learn more than you thought possible. There will be lows, but there will also be incredible highs. I am excited for all of you!

# Reading / Consuming List

I know you won't have time to read all of these, and I will underline that I was working on my startup for multiple years, consumed the below over that time and not all at the start.  That said, take a look and see what you're drawn to, will save for later, or what you'd prefer to skim or "get the Cliffs Notes" on.

In my humble opinion, most business books are kinda repetitive, bloated with too many case studies, or (I feel) surely inflated to meet a word count to make it feel like a worthy investment, and that's why there are multiple places (podcasts, YouTube videos, whole businesses in themselves) that just summarize business books, so consider those if you don't want to take the plunge on multiple tomes.  Given that there are many decent YouTube videos that summarize business topics, including where prominent authors do a lecture or talk on their work, I've linked to those where appropriate and would recommend listening to them on 1.5x speed (turn an hour-long lecture into a brisk 40 minutes!) and then reading the book for more if _and when_ you want a deeper dive.  Google Books also often has free digital previews of books, which is handy - I bootstrapped my startup so cutting any less-than-necessary expense was a guiding principle, and it is likely one of yours, too.  A lot of these resources won't mean all that much to you at such an early stage of product development (e.g. advice on how to hire effectively), so consuming a summary for now and returning for more when their topics become top of mind would be what I'd recommend.
