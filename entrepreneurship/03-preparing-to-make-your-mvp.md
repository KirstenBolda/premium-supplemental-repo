# How to Build and Launch Your Minimum Viable Product  

Welcome! This is a new series on how to build and launch a Minimum Viable Product (or MVP for short). In this series, I will cover how you can develop your MVP by walking you through each stage of the process and along the way I will breakdown terminology and share stories from founders who have done it. 

First of all, congrats on beginning this new path. Building a product is not easy. Despite the inundation of startup success stories in the media, the reality is, _entrepreneurship is hard_. However, the hardships can be mitigated by being organized, moving quickly through failures, and building a supportive community. The early days can and should be creative, experimental, fun and does not have to be lonely. As part of Codecademy, you already have an advantage that most founders I’ve met wished for during their early days so I encourage you to continue to deepen your connections with your fellow students and to be a resource for each other.

As for me, I'm Carmen - I am an Ecosystem Builder with a passion for startups, technology, inclusion and knowledge-sharing. I’ve worked both within startups and in startuip program development specifically for founders in the early stages of their businesses. Through this, I’ve reviewed hundreds of businesses (and business ideas) and have provided guidance to founders in various industries from when they are nowhere near ready to apply to an accelerator through to post-graduation. My goal in this series is to make the process less daunting and more importantly get your product where it needs to be for whatever comes after. After seeing so many founders go through this process, I hope I can help you avoid some common pain points.

There are an abundance of articles, books, videos, etc, on the topic of MVP (of course, I’ll be sharing some of those with you), however, building an MVP or startup is not an exact science. There will be examples and tools that are not applicable to what you are building and that’s fine (I will try my best to provide a variety of options). You should be using this series as a guideline on how you can you develop your product, not Gospel.

Okay, let's get to it. So what is an MVP and why do I have to build one? 

## What is an MVP?

The term Minimum Viable Product was coined by Eric Reis as part of the now ubiquitous _Lean Startup Method_ that he created. This method shortens the product development timeline to quickly determine if a proposed business model is viable. This ‘validated learning’ allows for you to learn about what your customers want while also permitting you to be agile and make changes quickly. 

Reis defines MVP as that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. That is to say, an MVP is a functional version of a product that allows you to gather information, test and iterate with the purpose of validating your product. MVPs are built rapidly so that there put in the hands of users for validation and feedback. 

One of the most important aspects of MVP development is that minimal effort is taken. Development should be cost effective (hopefully it will cost you nothing but your time) and nowadays there are tools to create sophisticated designs and interfaces. However, “minimal effort” does not mean the product does not work. Users should be able to engage with the product even if it is not the prettiest. Prioritizing a clear interface allows you to learn a lot about your users' experience. 

Having an MVP allows you to know whether what you’ve built something that people want, spend less time and/or money on building all the while getting quicker feedback. 

The upcoming articles in this series are divided into steps that will ultimately have you launch your MVP. Again, I will lead you through how to begin building your MVP, what to do once you are ready for launch as well best practices during and post launch. This series will conclude with resources I find to be helpful for development. 

I am excited to take this journey with you, so let’s do this. 

## Resource List

Eric Reis' [40 minute lecture](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) (or less if you increase playback speed) on MVPs is _highly_ recommended. Many people also read his book, which is a cornerstone of many other resources on modern tech entrepreneurship.
