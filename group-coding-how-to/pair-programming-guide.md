## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a useful thing to do while learning even if you don't do this at your eventual job (e.g. you want to be a solo freelancer).  It's more a specific dynamic for working together than a technical tool per se.  Many developer teams will occasionally use this skill in order to get past technical issues.

* If you're a beginner, watch two Codecademy employees pair program and follow along yourself [here](https://youtu.be/oG6x4PPJ0_w).  The course they cover will be relatively basic for some of you, but that's not a bad thing â€“ you can just skim through to see how they do it.

If you're interested in doing some pair-programming, and you should be, talk to your mentor about it!  They'll know when and if you're ready to take this on.  Often they'll want to pair-program with you first in a one-on-one so that you can get used to it before you do so with another learner.
