In this series of articles, we'll help you to understand the business development steps you'll need to take to make your product idea not only a reality but a successful one. These resources are designed to be consumed alongside your technical journey with Premium. You can complete them at any pace you'd like, but we'd strongly suggest you finish at least an initial read of the entire series (minus the reading lists) before you build any intricate functionality to your MVP. After all, you don't want to waste time building a product that customers won't want to buy or venture funds won't want to invest in.
